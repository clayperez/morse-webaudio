# Introduction

With the arrival of the WebAudio APIs, here's a morse code generator based on WebAudio.

So far this is a sketch set up as a test for browser support across dekstop and mobile browsers. 

# TODO

* Cross-browserness
* Tests
  * unit tests
  * calibration of generation speed (WPM)
* Tidy up code
* A decent test example on github.io site
* Packaging
* Morse generation from web audio APIs.

# Status

An experiment.  Interested in comments & ideas.  Looking for code contributions later.
