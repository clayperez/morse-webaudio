# Introduction

This is (so far) a test of generating morse code using Web Audio APIs.

At this point, this is really set up as a test for browser support across dekstop and mobile browsers.

# TODO

* Tests
  * unit tests
  * calibration of generation speed (WPM)
* Tidy up code
* A decent test example on github.io site
* Packaging
* Morse generation from web audio APIs.

# Status

An experiment.  Interested in comments & ideas.  Looking for code contributions later.
